# EuroBike

Welcome to EuroBike!

EuroBike is a bike planning app designed to help bikers to travel long distance across Europe. The function of the app is twofold: provide biking routes across multiple European States and remove the hassle of what to pack for a long trip. It is targeted towards bikers of all levels (basic, intermediate, pro) offering different packing solutions for each of them. 
The site acts as a repository for trips where users can store all the data for the organisation of their next trips.

## User Experience (UX)

An user of EuroBike would be someone who is passionate about biking long distance and who likes travelling by bike for multiple days. For such trips, packing smartly to reduce weight and use less space is essential. Or alternatively, packing everything you need could be for some bikers top priority rather than weight. 
On top of that, a visitor of EuroBike can find in the app a map of the chosen route.
